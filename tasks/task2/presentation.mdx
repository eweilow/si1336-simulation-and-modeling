## 2.1  - Effects of rounding errors on a population model

![](./plots/2_1/r091.png)
![](./plots/2_1/r06.png)

<p>
When{" "}
<InlineTex texContent={"$$r < r_\\infty$$"}/>, 
rounding doesn't affect the system. 
</p>

<p>
When{" "}
<InlineTex texContent={"$$r > r_\\infty$$"}/>, 
rounding <b>does</b> affect the system.
</p>

## 2.2 - The Lyapunov exponent for a population model

![](./plots/2_2/study.png)

<p>
The sign of{" "}
<InlineTex texContent={"$$\\lambda$$"}/>{" "}
is positive for{" "}
<InlineTex texContent={"$$0.76 < r < r_\\infty$$"}/>, that is: <em>if the system is not chaotic the sign is positive.</em>.
</p>

<p>
The effects of rounding doesn't have much of an impact unless{" "}
<InlineTex texContent={"$$r > r_\\infty$$"}/>
</p>

## 2.2 - The dependence on initial value

![](./plots/2_2/dependence.png)

<p>
Can see no dependence on{" "}
<InlineTex texContent={"$$x_0$$"}/> for the Lyapunov exponent.
</p>

## 2.3 - Lorenz attractor

<p>
  Using a small timestep of{" "}
<InlineTex texContent={"$$\\Delta t = 0.00008$$"}/>{" "}
for a random sample of initial values:
<br/>
<br/>
<InlineTex texContent={"$$x_0 \\in (-1000, 1000)$$"}/>
<br/>
<InlineTex texContent={"$$y_0 \\in (-1000, 1000)$$"}/>
<br/>
<InlineTex texContent={"$$z_0 \\in (-1000, 1000)$$"}/>
</p>

## 2.3 - Lorenz attractor

25 CPU hours later...

![](./plots/2_3/histo.png)

<p>
Can see that the average of
<InlineTex texContent={" $$r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$$ "}/>
over a time period of
<InlineTex texContent={" $$0 < t < 150$$, "}/>
is more or less bounded by 
<InlineTex texContent={" $$r \\lt 60$$ "}/>
</p>

Can thus conclude that it's very unlikely that a solution doesn't get attracted into the basin.

## 2.4 Lorenz attractor, sensitivity to initial values

![](./plots/2_4/solution.png)
![](./plots/2_4/difference.png)

Even for small difference in initial value, the solutions differ much after some time...

## 2.5

![](./plots/2_5/study.png)
![](./plots/2_5/peaks.png)

<p>
The left plot shows z(t) for a solution starting in 
<InlineTex texContent={" $$x(0) = 10, y(0) = 0, z(0) = 0$$"}/>
</p>
<p>
From the right plot, it's obvious that the ratio 
<InlineTex texContent={" $$\\frac{z_{m+1}}{z_m}$$ "}/>
isn't always greater than unity. Can we thus conclude that the Lorenz attractor is semi-chaotic?
