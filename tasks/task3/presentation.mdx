## 3.1 Particle in a box

## 3.1 - 8 particles

## 3.1 - 64 particles

## 3.1 - 80 particles

## 3.1 - equilibrium?

Let's define equilibrium as a steady time average.

## 3.1 - equilibrium?

![](./plots/3_1/8_study_mean.png)

![](./plots/3_1/64_study_mean.png)

![](./plots/3_1/80_study_mean.png)

It's pretty conclusive that equilibrium is particles evenly split between both left and right.

---

## 3.1 - equilibrium?

![](./plots/3_1/8_histogram.png)

![](./plots/3_1/64_histogram.png)

![](./plots/3_1/80_histogram.png)

Even clearer when looking at histograms of end values for all simulations.

---

## 3.1 - equilibrium?

![](./plots/3_1/80_study.png)

The number of particles fluctuate even when at an "equilibrium", even though average is steady.

---

## 3.2 - deterministic time dependence of n

The qualitive behavior of n(t) is that it tends to half of N, with random fluctuations.

## 3.3 Effects of seeding

![](./plots/3_3/8_study.png)

![](./plots/3_3/64_study.png)

![](./plots/3_3/80_study.png)

The first simulation doesn't at first glance appear to have much different behaviour.

---

## 3.3 Effects of seeding

![](./plots/3_3/8_histogram.png)

![](./plots/3_3/64_histogram.png)

![](./plots/3_3/80_histogram.png)

The histograms tell another story...

---

## 3.3 Effects of seeding

... because all the simulations are run with the same seed.
They are all the same!

---

## 3.4 Equilibrium fluctuations

![](./plots/3_4/comparison.png)

![](./plots/3_4/many.png)

![](./plots/3_4/single.png)

Can see that computing from many simulations stabilize on a value faster

---

## 3.5 Equilibrium

![](./plots/3_5/comparison.png)

![](./plots/3_5/many.png)

![](./plots/3_5/single.png)

The average \<n\> for many simulations becomes stable at 40, which to me is the expected value.

---

## 3.5 Equilibrium

![](./plots/3_5/comparison.png)

![](./plots/3_1/80_histogram.png)

This is also shown in 3.1, as the center of the histogram is 40.

---

## 3.6 Random walks!

## 3.7 Custom random number generator

### Varying r

![](./plots/3_7/randomwalk_1000_r3_a3_c4_m128.png)

Not that great, it forms patterns...

## 3.7 Custom random number generator

### Varying m

![](./plots/3_7/randomwalk_1000_r1_a3_c4_m129.png)

![](./plots/3_7/randomwalk_1000_r1_a3_c4_m130.png)

Not that great, it forms patterns...

### Varying a & c

## 3.8 End-to-end distance

![](./plots/3_8/walklen.png)

Turns out that <i>\<R<sup>2</sup>\> â‰ˆ walk length</i>

---

## 3.9 Self intersection prevention

![](./plots/3_9/randomwalk_15.png)

![](./plots/3_9/randomwalk_25.png)

![](./plots/3_9/randomwalk_50.png)

Some samples

---

## 3.9 Self intersection prevention

![](./plots/3_9/success_fraction.png)

Can double the walk length if we prevent walks from returning in the same direction as previous step,
while still keeping the same success ratio ...

---

## 3.9 Self intersection prevention

![](./plots/3_9/per_success.png)

... but the attempts per successful non-self-intersecting walk is MUCH less for walks with back-move protection.

---

## 3.10 Self intersection prevention

![](./plots/3_10/walklen_with.png)

![](./plots/3_10/walklen_without.png)

Can get much further on average by preventing back-moves.
