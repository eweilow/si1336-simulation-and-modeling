# Cellular automaton traffic model

---

## (4.1) Sample solutions

![sim1](./plots/4_1/sim1.png)

Probability of braking: **50%**.
Density: **20%**.
Road length: **50**.

---

## (4.2) Flow rate as function of density

![sim1](./plots/4_2/density.png)

Traffic jams start happening around a density of **30%**.

---

## (4.3) Effects of different maximum velocities

![sim1](./plots/4_3/sim1.png)

<p>
  Can see that the flow rate for
  <InlineTex texContent=" $$v_{max} = 2$$ " />
  is about the same as for
  <InlineTex texContent=" $$v_{max} = 5$$" />,
  <br />
  yet
  <InlineTex texContent=" $$v_{max} = 5$$ " />
  sees more abrupt stopping.
</p>

## (4.4) Effects of different probability of braking

![sim1](./plots/4_4/sim1.png)

The lower the probability, the better traffic flows.

tl;dr **STOP USING PHONES IN TRAFFIC =)**

# Forest fire model

## (4.5) Sample solution

![sim1](./plots/4_5/sample.png)

---

## (4.5) N(s)

![sim1](./plots/4_5/histogram.png)

<p>
  The size of tree clusters that burn seem to be quite proportional to
  <InlineTex texContent=" $$N s^{-\alpha}$$ " />
</p>

---

## (4.5) Variation of g and f

![sim1](./plots/4_5/parameters.png)

There seems to be a line around a growth probability of around 0.3 where alpha is greatest.
