## 1.1 - Pendulums vs harmonic oscillators

![](./plots/1_1/comparison_1.png)
![](./plots/1_1/comparison_2.png)
![](./plots/1_1/comparison_3.png)

Pendulum has slightly longer period.

## 1.1 - Pendulums: general solutions

![](./plots/1_1/sol_pendulum_1.png)
![](./plots/1_1/sol_pendulum_2.png)
![](./plots/1_1/sol_pendulum_3.png)

Energy doesn't scale linearly with increased starting angle.

## 1.1 - Harmonic oscillators: general solutions

![](./plots/1_1/sol_harmonic_1.png)
![](./plots/1_1/sol_harmonic_2.png)
![](./plots/1_1/sol_harmonic_3.png)

Basically the same solutions as for pendulums.

<p>
Euler takes off immediately... Runge Kutta becomes "good" for{" "}

## 1.1 - Rolling mean of energy for harmonic oscillator
![](./plots/1_1/rollingMean_harmonic_1.png)
![](./plots/1_1/rollingMean_harmonic_2.png)
![](./plots/1_1/rollingMean_harmonic_3.png)

Same result as for pendulum, expected since period is almost same.

## 1.1 - Harmonic oscillators: Numerical vs analytic

![](./plots/1_1/comparison_numanalytic_2.png)
![](./plots/1_1/comparison_numanalytic_3.png)

Using Verlet integration: sees a drift in period, but the numerical integration is stable.

## 1.2 Period time as function of initial position
![](./plots/1_2/period.png)

Harmonic oscillator has constant period, smaller than pendulum.
The perturbation series does not approximate the harmonic oscillator well.

## 1.3 Dampened harmonic oscillator

![](./plots/1_3/dampened_dx.png)
![](./plots/1_3/dampened_E.png)
![](./plots/1_3/dampened_x.png)

Energy decreases over time with dampening.

## 1.3 Relaxation time as function of γ
![](./plots/1_3/study.png)

<p>
Method: fit{" "}
<InlineTex texContent={"$$f(t) = A e^{-Bt}$$"}/>
{" "}to local peaks of simulated oscillations.
</p>
<p>
For critical dampening{" "}
<InlineTex texContent={"$$\\gamma_c \\approx 5.9$$"}/>
{" "}, only 1 peak x(0) exists and f(t) cannot be fit.

## 1.3 Minimum x as function of γ

## 1.4 Phase space portrait of dampened pendulum
![](./plots/1_4/study.png)

We get a spiral in phase space, that creeps towards (0, 0).

## 1.5 Leapfrog vs Velocity Verlet
![](./plots/1_5/study.png)

Both are energy preserving over long time, even for silly large time steps.

---

## 1.5 Leapfrog vs Velocity Verlet
![](./plots/1_5/study2.png)

Leapfrog produces different trajectory.

## 1.5 Leapfrog vs Velocity Verlet
Main advantage to leapfrog: only have to calculate acceleration once per time step.
