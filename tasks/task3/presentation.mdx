## 3.1 - equilibrium?

Let's define equilibrium as a steady time average.

It's pretty conclusive that equilibrium is particles evenly split between both left and right.

Even clearer when looking at histograms of end values for all simulations.

## 3.1 - equilibrium?

The number of particles fluctuate even when at an "equilibrium", even though average is steady.

---

## 3.2 - deterministic time dependence of n

The qualitive behavior of n(t) is that it tends to half of N, with random fluctuations.

## 3.3 Effects of seeding

The first simulation doesn't at first glance appear to have much different behaviour.

The histograms tell another story...

## 3.3 Effects of seeding

... because all the simulations are run with the same seed.
They are all the same!
